# How to Contribute to the PasswordBox App
## How to Find Tasks
We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KaitoMuraoka/PasswordBox/issues) for task management. Please search for an issue you would like to contribute to there. Issues labeled with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/KaitoMuraoka/PasswordBox/contribute) are recommended for your first contribution.

You can also submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/KaitoMuraoka/PasswordBox/pulls) without an existing issue. In that case, please provide details such as the reason, cause, and solution in the Pull Request.

## How to Start Contributing
If you find a task you want to work on, leave a comment on the issue (e.g., “:raising_hand:”) to avoid overlapping work with others.
We will respond to your comment as soon as possible, but feel free to start working on the task once you’ve commented!

## How to Discuss and Propose Ideas
Using GitHub Issues is preferable, but if you have specific ideas for implementation or refactoring, Pull Requests are also welcome.

## App Translation
his project is managed on Crowdin.
For translations, please contribute via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/passwordbox-ios).
If you would like to add any languages, please write it in an [Issue](https://github.com/KaitoMuraoka/PasswordBox/issues).

## Web site
TBD

## App Design
I am not a designer. If you have better app or icon designs, please feel free to create an issue.

## Languages for Issues, Comments, and Reviews

Please use either English or Japanese for comments.

## Note
If you have any questions, feel free to ask anything through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KaitoMuraoka/PasswordBox/issues)!
